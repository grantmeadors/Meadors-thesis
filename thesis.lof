\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ is derived from differential arm motion (DARM), read-out from a photodiode downstream of the antisymmetric port. A small ghost beam from a reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an inner test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in different arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel. To a lesser extent, changes in the length of PRC, which is defined as $\delta (l_+) \equiv \delta (l_y + l_x)/2$ and is measured in quadrature demodulation with respect to the MICH pick-off, also add noise to DARM.}}{17}{figure.2.1}

Statistically significant coherence justifies fitting; in frequency bands where coherence rose above background levels, the transfer function fit was weighted more heavily.}}{23}{figure.2.2}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.6}{\ignorespaces Calibration line test: before-feedforward mean of the 393.1 Hz line and two neighboring FFT bins was $1.3082 \times 10^{-21}$, after was $1.3128 \times 10^{-21}$. Feedforward made the calibration line region noisier by $4.6 \times 10^{-24}$ or 0.35\%, suggesting that we correctly apply Hann-windowed feedforward without subtracting true $h(t)$ signal. Moreover, no spectral line combs are observed to either side of the calibration line peak at 393.1 Hz, indicating that the method does not introduce windowing artifacts.}}{31}{figure.2.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces Time-domain plot of diagnostic channels from a burst injection: the simultaneous envelope increase after 1.8 s indicates that the burst injection is correctly time-stamped in the new data. Before-feedforward and after-feedforward traces occult each other in the graph, because they are almost identical.}}{32}{figure.2.7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.8}{\ignorespaces Cross-correlation pairwise between pre-, post-feedforward, and injection data: the extrema and zero-crossings match. Note both before-feedforward (blue) and after-feedforward (green) strain traces are almost identical and therefore overlap. The strains appear inverted, but in the same way, due to a sign error in the hardware injections at this time.}}{32}{figure.2.8}
