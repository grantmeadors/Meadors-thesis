\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Enhanced LIGO primary systems and optics. From left, the phase-stablized laser (PSL) produces coherent light, kept at constant frequency by the frequency-stabilization servo (FSS). The pre-mode cleaner excludes non-Gaussian beamshapes, allowing only the $TEM_{00}$ mode to pass. The beam is the phase-modulated using three electro-optical modulators (EOMs) before being further shaped in the input mode cleaner (IMC). The beam passes through the power recycling mirror (RM) and is split at the beam-splitter (BS). Along the $X$ and $Y$ arms, light resonates in the Fabry-Perot cavity formed between the input test mass (ITM) mirror and the end test (mass) ETM mirror, before recombining at the beamsplitting. Any light with the same phase as before the arms is returned to the interferometer by the RM, but if phase-shifted, perhaps by a gravitational wave, it exits through the output mode cleaner (OMC): a photodiode just downstream of the OMC records the signal.}}{19}{figure.1.3}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.5}{\ignorespaces Omega scan of an audible broadband glitch. Shortly before the start of Science Run 6, detector characterization took place to identify categories of glitches, such as the `gremlin', and to eliminate them. The burst group analysis pipeline, Omega, generated time-frequency spectrograms that made this identification easier. Glitches are a limiting factor in the identification of rare events and therefore of potential gravitational wave burst signals.}}{22}{figure.1.5}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.6}{\ignorespaces Real-time servo loop diagram. The MICH\_CTRL signal can be though to leak into the true DARM signal via a transfer function, H\_0. (The letter `h' is typical for transfer functions as well as gravitational wave strain; coincidentally, this is a noise transfer into the channel for displacement, DARM, which is proportional to strain $h(t)$). H\_0 leaks into error signal, which is otherwise kept null thanks to the servo cancellation provided by DARM\_CTRL times a physical actuation function AC. The measured error signal is DARM\_IN1. If desired, an excitation can be supplied via DARM\_EXC for a sum of DARM\_IN2. This error signal passes though digital filters D to yield the aforementioned control signal DARM\_CTRL. The auxiliary length cancellation loop is simply adding H\_md to DARM\_CTRL in order to subtract out the corruption of H\_0.}}{23}{figure.1.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.7}{\ignorespaces Real-time work on a LIGO noise filter. This Bode plot, made in Matlab, shows the correction to the existing MICH damping (cancellation) loop needed mid-2010, toward the end of Science Run 6. The correction is small, because the majority of the coupling fits the flat model expected from theory. This transfer function estimate suffices for post-factor correction. However, in order to be incorporated into the control scheme shown in Figure\nobreakspace \ref {servo_loop_realtime}, measurements of the open loop gain $G$ and actuation function AC are necessary to yield incorporate the filter correctly into the closed loop response.}}{24}{figure.1.7}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ is derived from differential arm motion (DARM), read-out from a photodiode downstream of the antisymmetric port. An internal reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an input test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in differential arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel. To a lesser extent, changes in the length of PRC, which is defined as $\delta (l_+) \equiv \delta (l_y + l_x)/2$ and is measured in quadrature demodulation with respect to the MICH pick-off, also add noise to DARM.}}{34}{figure.2.1}

Feedforward made the calibration line region noisier by $3.1 \times 10^{-24}$ or 0.35\%, suggesting that we correctly apply Hann-windowed feedforward without subtracting true $h(t)$. Moreover, no spectral line combs are observed to either side of the calibration line peak at 393.1 Hz, indicating that the method does not introduce windowing artifacts.}}{49}{figure.2.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces Time-domain plot of diagnostic channels from a burst injection. Colors are illustrative only to the fact that the envelopes of the traces increase after 1.8 s, indicating that the burst injection time is correct in the new data. `Before feedforward' and `after feedforward' traces occult each other in the graph, because they are almost identical. `Before feedforward' is $h(t)$ data; `after feedforward` is $h(t)$ with feedforward subtraction. `Injection estimated strain' is the digital injection as intended to be introduced into strain, but the actual injection is made on the end test mass X (ETMX), so the calibrated `Injection estimated ETMX' is also displayed. Raw `DARM\_ERR' and `ETMX\_EXC\_DAQ' are redundant but reinforce the trend.}}{50}{figure.2.7}

Note both before-feedforward (blue) and after-feedforward (green) strain traces are almost identical and therefore overlap. The strains appear inverted, but in the same way, due to a sign error in the hardware injections at this time. The absence of a time lag shift between before and after indicates that feedforward has not altered the phase of the data, at least for this injection. The equivalence in cross-correlation magnitude indicates that amplitude also is unaffected.}}{51}{figure.2.8}

Read `DARM' as $h(t)$, `MICH' as `MICH-PRC'. The most benefit is seen in the 80 to 400 Hz band, especially around 150 Hz, where LIGO is most sensitive. The main fundamental limit in this band is thermal suspension noise, but historically auxiliary channel noise has been a major contaminant. Note that the 60 Hz and harmonic lines are not subtracted, although a separate magnetometer servo does reduce their impact. The 330 Hz violin mode is not likely amenable to feedforward.}}{56}{figure.2.11}

Read `DARM' as $h(t)$, `MICH' as `MICH-PRC'. Such a loud cross-coupling would be noticed in real-time by the on-site staff.

The mean shows the absolute and relative difference of before and after, between the average of many spectra. Improvement from 80 to 400 Hz is noticeable; at higher frequencies there is degradation, negligible in relative terms, due to high-frequency filter rolloff. Frequencies below 50 Hz should be disregarded; they are usually not searched by LIGO, so spectra for this plot were generated with a high-pass filter at 38 Hz.}}{58}{figure.2.13}

In this first month of S6, L1 saw greater benefit from post-facto feedforward correction; later data from H1 and L1 would improve by fluctuating amounts thanks to better real-time feedforward servos.
