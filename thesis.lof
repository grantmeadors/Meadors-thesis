\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ is derived from differential arm motion (DARM), read-out from a photodiode downstream of the antisymmetric port. An internal reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an input test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in differential arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel. To a lesser extent, changes in the length of PRC, which is defined as $\delta (l_+) \equiv \delta (l_y + l_x)/2$ and is measured in quadrature demodulation with respect to the MICH pick-off, also add noise to DARM.}}{23}{figure.2.1}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.6}{\ignorespaces Calibration line test: before-feedforward mean of the 393.1 Hz line and two neighboring FFT bins was $8.7261 \times 10^{-22}$, after was $8.7569 \times 10^{-22}$. Feedforward made the calibration line region noisier by $3.1 \times 10^{-24}$ or 0.35\%, suggesting that we correctly apply Hann-windowed feedforward without subtracting true $h(t)$. Moreover, no spectral line combs are observed to either side of the calibration line peak at 393.1 Hz, indicating that the method does not introduce windowing artifacts.}}{38}{figure.2.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces Time-domain plot of diagnostic channels from a burst injection. Colors are illustrative only to the fact that the envelopes of the traces increase after 1.8 s, indicating that the burst injection time is correct in the new data. `Before feedforward' and `after feedforward' traces occult each other in the graph, because they are almost identical. `Before feedforward' is $h(t)$ data; `after feedforward` is $h(t)$ with feedforward subtraction. `Injection estimated strain' is the digital injection as intended to be introduced into strain, but the actual injection is made on the end test mass X (ETMX), so the calibrated `Injection estimated ETMX' is also displayed. Raw `DARM\_ERR' and `ETMX\_EXC\_DAQ' are redundant but reinforce the trend.}}{39}{figure.2.7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.8}{\ignorespaces Cross-correlation pairwise between $h(t)$ pre-, post-feedforward, and ETMX injection data: the extrema and zero-crossings match. Note both before-feedforward (blue) and after-feedforward (green) strain traces are almost identical and therefore overlap. The strains appear inverted, but in the same way, due to a sign error in the hardware injections at this time. The absence of a time lag shift between before and after indicates that feedforward has not altered the phase of the data, at least for this injection. The equivalence in cross-correlation magnitude indicates that amplitude also is unaffected.}}{40}{figure.2.8}

Read `DARM' as $h(t)$, `MICH' as `MICH-PRC'. The most benefit is seen in the 80 to 400 Hz band, especially around 150 Hz, where LIGO is most sensitive. The main fundamental limit in this band is thermal suspension noise, but historically auxiliary channel noise has been a major contaminant. Note that the 60 Hz and harmonic lines are not subtracted, although a separate magnetometer servo does reduce their impact. The 330 Hz violin mode is not likely amenable to feedforward.}}{44}{figure.2.11}

Read `DARM' as $h(t)$, `MICH' as `MICH-PRC'. Such a loud cross-coupling would be noticed in real-time by the on-site staff. The elevated noise floor is unusual in science mode, but the fact that feedforward corrects it suggests the importance of controlling auxiliary channels to prevent such glitches.

The mean shows the absolute and relative difference of before and after, between the average of many spectra. Improvement from 80 to 400 Hz is noticeable; at higher frequencies there is degradation, negligible in relative terms, due to high-frequency filter rolloff. Frequencies below 50 Hz should be disregarded; they are usually not searched by LIGO, so spectra for this plot were generated with a high-pass filter at 38 Hz.}}{46}{figure.2.13}

In this first month of S6, L1 saw greater benefit from post-facto feedforward correction; later data from H1 and L1 would improve by fluctuating amounts thanks to better real-time feedforward servos. Although H1 is less improved than L1 here, real-time tunings were made soon after.}}{47}{figure.2.14}
