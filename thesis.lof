From left, the phase-stablized laser (PSL) produces coherent light, kept at constant frequency by the frequency-stabilization servo (FSS). The pre-mode cleaner excludes non-Gaussian beamshapes, allowing only the $TEM_{00}$ mode to pass. The beam is the phase-modulated using three electro-optical modulators (EOMs) before being further shaped in the input mode cleaner (IMC). The beam passes through the power recycling mirror (RM) and is split at the beam-splitter (BS). Along the $X$ and $Y$ arms, light resonates in the Fabry-Perot cavity formed between the input test mass (ITM) mirror and the end test (mass) ETM mirror, before recombining at the beamsplitting. Any light with the same phase as before the arms is returned to the interferometer by the RM, but if phase-shifted, perhaps by a gravitational wave, it exits through the output mode cleaner (OMC): a photodiode just downstream of the OMC records the signal.}}{25}{figure.1.3}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.6}{\ignorespaces Real-time servo loop diagram. The MICH\_CTRL signal can be though to leak into the true DARM signal via a transfer function, H\_0. (The letter `h' is typical for transfer functions as well as gravitational wave strain; coincidentally, this is a noise transfer into the channel for displacement, DARM, which is proportional to strain $h(t)$). H\_0 leaks into error signal, which is otherwise kept null thanks to the servo cancellation provided by DARM\_CTRL times a physical actuation function AC. The measured error signal is DARM\_IN1. If desired, an excitation can be supplied via DARM\_EXC for a sum of DARM\_IN2. This error signal passes though digital filters D to yield the aforementioned control signal DARM\_CTRL. The auxiliary length cancellation loop is simply adding H\_md to DARM\_CTRL in order to subtract out the corruption of H\_0.}}{28}{figure.1.6}

This Bode plot, made in Matlab, shows the correction to the existing MICH damping (cancellation) loop needed mid-2010, toward the end of Science Run 6. The correction is small, because the majority of the coupling fits the flat model expected from theory. This transfer function estimate suffices for post-factor correction. However, in order to be incorporated into the control scheme shown in Figure\nobreakspace \ref {servo_loop_realtime}, measurements of the open loop gain $G$ and actuation function AC are necessary to yield incorporate the filter correctly into the closed loop response.}}{29}{figure.1.7}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ is derived from differential arm motion (DARM), read-out from a photodiode downstream of the antisymmetric port. An internal reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an input test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in differential arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel. To a lesser extent, changes in the length of PRC, which is defined as $\delta (l_+) \equiv \delta (l_y + l_x)/2$ and is measured in quadrature demodulation with respect to the MICH pick-off, also add noise to DARM.}}{39}{figure.2.1}

The main fundamental limit in this band is thermal suspension noise, but historically auxiliary channel noise has been a major contaminant.
