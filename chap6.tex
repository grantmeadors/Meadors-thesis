        \section{Directed TwoSpect}
        \label{directed}

TwoSpect performed aptly in Chapter~\ref{chap5}'s Mock Data Challenge, which warrants using the program to analyze the best existing GW data.
At the time of writing, the best consistent stretch of data remains Science Run 6 (S6) taken from 2009 July 09 to 2010 October 20 by LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO).
Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) commissioning is already surpassing the sensitivity of S6 for short periods of time.
While early LIGO continuous wave (CW) searches used short science runs such as S2~\cite{AbbottScoX12007}, aLIGO data duration is for now too short for an analysis competitive with present upper limits, in particular the 2011 Radiometer~\cite{AbadieStoch2011} S5 high frequency results and 2014 TwoSpect~\cite{GoetzTwoSpectResults2014} S6 low frequency results.
The increased sensitivity anticipated from aLIGO Observing Run 1 (O1), which is planned to last several months in summer 2015, could yield interesting results, and the year-length O3 is planned before the end of the decade.
Scorpius X-1 broadband upper limits from S6 are the direction of this chapter.

            %TwoSpect improvements myself (to do).

            \subsection{Targeted, directed and all-sky search sensitivity}
            \label{tradeoffs}

Several approaches exist toward a search from GW from known objects such as Scorpius X-1.
When seeking continuous GW, these methods are classified as all-sky, directed, or targeted, in order of increasing focus of the search.
More focused searches make sense as more prior information is known, such as neutron star frequency and binary system orbital parameters.

             %   Targeted (known object) vs directed (region)vs all-sky (everything).

            %We have a great deal of material here already, just need to pull from figures and commentary from the Sco X-1 wiki. Keith recommends paralleling the Sco X-1 paper.



\subsection{S6: Scorpius X-1 search plan}

\textbf{2 kHz, $\pm 3 \sigma_{a \sin i}$ search over all S6 data from H1 \& L1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze 40 to 360 Hz with 840 s SFTs,
\item Analyze 360 to 2040 Hz with 360 s SFTs,\\
(to prevent spectral leakage)
\item Now planned: overlapping bands to verify
\item Search over 300+1100 Hz = 1.4 kHz complete on H1
\item Search over 300+1700 Hz = 2.0 kHz complete on L1

Joint upper limits for Scorpius X-1, using a confidence interval given by reported $h_0 \times \left( 1 + 1.0 \right) \times \left[\cos\iota \textup{ factor}\right]$ in 0.1 Hz bands. 
This spectrum covers 40 to 2040 Hz using the lower upper limit from either interferomer (H1 or L1) when both yielded data. 
A total of 28.8 Hz were in bands that yielded no real upper limit (because the quarter root of the test statistic was imaginary) in either interferometer, generally due to excessive noise in that band.
Bands were left-closed and right open, e.g., $\left[ 40.0,40.1\right), \left[ 40.1,40.2\right)\ldots \left[2039.9,2040.0\right)$.

\section{Summary of Directed TwoSpect S6 searches}

\textbf{2 kHz, $\pm 3 \sigma_{a \sin i}$ search over all S6 data from H1 \& L1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze 40 to 360 Hz with 840 s SFTs,
\item Analyze 360 to 2040 Hz with 360 s SFTs,\\
(to prevent spectral leakage)
\item Now planned: overlapping bands to verify
\item Search over 300+1700 Hz = 2.0 kHz complete on H1
\item Search over 300+1700 Hz = 2.0 kHz complete on L1
\end{itemize}


\emph{S6 search \textbf{100\% done} in 30 days, with 2 kHz per H1, L1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Should verify overlapping bands with shorter coherence length
\item Refining upper limit methodology
\item R statistic: quiet 0.1 Hz bands need investigation
\item Detection criteria: how applicable is MDC experience?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Random polarization} $h_0$ lower limit might be $< 1.3\times10^{-24}$
\emph{Outliers} incoming: already $\sim 22$ coincident features in [40, 360] Hz
