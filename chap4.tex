Gravitational wave interferometry measures changes in light travel time far less than the light-crossing time of an atom, so the quantum nature of light has always influenced detector design.
Advanced LIGO aims to resolve most of noise sources described in Sections~\ref{methods} and~\ref{interferometer_theory}: even so, quantum shot and radiation pressure noise from light will remain.
Carlton Caves correctly derived the quantum behavior of interferometer shot and radiation pressure noise~\cite{Caves1980}.
Prior work had inferred the shot noise level from classical principles, accurately, but been ambiguous about radiation pressure.
With the quantum noise clarified, it was realized that this noise could be reduced through so-called squeezing of the vacuum state~\cite{Caves1981}.
This chapter describes part of how squeezing was successfully realized three decades later at the LIGO Hanford Observatory.
For additional details, consult Chua~\cite{ChuaThesis} and Dwyer~\cite{DwyerThesis}.

    \section{Squeezing theory}
    \label{squeezing_theory}

      %  Squeezing theory.
Quantum noise was initially treated as Poissonian photon counting (shot noise) and momentum coupling (radiation pressure), but it is better understood as the phase and amplitude uncertainty of the electromagnetic field at the interferometer output. 
Roughly speaking, phase uncertainty is equivalent to semi-classical shot noise and amplitude uncertainty to radiation pressure.
The standard quantum limit (SQL) on displacement sensitivity can be derived independently of either argument, as noted by Caves~\cite{Caves1981}:

\begin{equation}
(\Delta z)_{\textup{SQL}} = (2 \hbar \tau / m)^{1/2},
\label{sql_caves}
\end{equation}

\noindent where in Equation~\ref{sql_caves} $z$ is the mirror (test mass) displacement, $\tau$ is measurement duration, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $m$ is mirror mass.
When one tries to attain this standard quantum limit with an interferometer, then shot and radiation pressure are found to balance at a particular optimum input power $P_0$~\cite{Caves1981}:

\begin{equation}
P_0 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{mc^2}{\tau}\frac{1}{\omega \tau} \frac{1}{b^2} \equiv {\hbar \omega \alpha_0^2}{\tau},
\label{optimum_power_caves}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\omega$ the angular frequency of light and $b$ the number of bounces (assuming delay lines, whereas a Fabry-Perot is proportional to finesse) in Equation~\ref{optimum_power_caves} and $\alpha_0 = \sqrt{P \tau / \hbar \omega}$ is the number of photons.
The latter equation shows that the optimal power rises as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, that is, as the squart root of the gravitational wave frequency.
Higher laser power improves high frequency sensitivity, high mirror mass improves low frequency performance.
Combined, these formulae imply that an interferometer should be built with the largest, most massive mirrors and most powerful lasers practicable.

        \subsection{Problems with lasers: thermal compensation}
        \label{TCS}

            %Experience (some firsthand) with thermal compensation.

LIGO and its allied interferometers do try to operate with massive optics and powerful lasers, but there are limits.
Vacuum enclosures place a constraint, only broken with significant expenditures, on the size of optical tables and mirror suspensions and therefore on mirror mass.
This indirectly limits laser power through the SQL.
Laser power, however, was not limited for this reason in initial and enhanced LIGO.
In practice, thermal distortion of the test masses was a worse problem~\cite{BallmerThesis}.
Absorption, both in the bulk of the fused silica substrate and in the HR coatings, of a few parts per million was sufficient to distort the radius of curvature of the Fabry-Perot cavities.
While managed with a $\textup{CO}_2$ laser-driven thermal compensation system (supplemented with ring heaters in aLIGO), this thermal distortion remains a serious concern.

Having an alternative to increased mirror size and laser power would grant flexibility.
Hence squeezing: the standard quantum limit can be achieved through another means.


        \subsection{Quantum shot noise and radiation pressure}
        \label{quantum_noise}

            %Carlton Caves, quantum shot noise and radiation pressure.

%\begin{frame}{Squeezing introduction}

%\begin{definition}

Squeezing as used in the context of gravitational made interferometer has a specific meaning.
While no alterations are made to the input laser light, the output `dark' port of the interferometer, whence comes the light received by the photodetector, is changed.
The output port in a squeezed interferometer receives a squeezed vacuum state from the opposite direction to the laser light.
This squeezed vacuum state is prepared on a `squeezer' table.
This beam is injected with the correct polarization, using a Faraday isolator and wave plates to guard against laser light entering the squeezer, and propagates through the interferometer arms (requiring proper alignment) until it and the laser light are both incident on the same output photodetector.
The desired effect is altering $\Delta E\Delta\phi$ uncertainty for the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field.
Reducing $\Delta \phi$ at the cost of still-acceptable $\Delta E$ permits\footnote{$\Delta E$ can also be squeezed; see Section~\ref{third-gen_squeezing}} a more precise measurement, equivalent to the beneficial effect of increasing laser power but without heating the mirrors.
Casually, more laser power boosts the shot-noise limited `signal' of a high-frequency measurement whereas squeezing reduces the `noise'. 
Formally, the expectation value of quantum operators is improved.

%\begin{theorem}
%Shot noise arises from quantum operators (Caves 1980, 1981)\end{theorem}

Caves's prescription~\cite{Caves1981} is clear:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vacuum fluctuations couple through anti-symmetric port, so inject a
\item \emph{Squeezed } $\overrightarrow{E}$ field (uncertainty ellipse with smaller $\Delta E$) defined by
\item Squeeze operator $S$ in Equation~\ref{squeeze_operator_caves} (with squeeze angle $\theta$, factor $r$, creation operator $a$):
\end{itemize}
%From the Caves squeezing paper~\cite{Caves1981},

\begin{equation}
S(\zeta)=\exp[\frac{1}{2}\zeta^{*}a^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\zeta(a^{\dagger})^{2}],\;\zeta=re^{i\theta}
\label{squeeze_operator_caves}
\end{equation}

\noindent thereby reducing shot noise by a factor of $e^{-r}$. The optimum power changes accordingly: Caves shows that $P_\textup{opt} = P_0 e^{-2r}$, so long as $|\alpha|\gg\sinh^2r$ and $|\alpha|\gg e^{2r}\sinh^2 r$. 

For a 20 W interferometer using 1.064 nm to measure at 100 Hz, the latter squeezing condition would be an issue around $r\geq10$, but to reduce optimal power by $1/2$ only requires $r \approx 0.34$. 
Trying to reduce optimal power by orders of magnitude is unlikely to occur any time soon: rather, a modest laser as would ordinarily be used in an interferometer can be supplemented with a squeezed beam to increase its effective power. 
Squeezing is an addition, not a replacement.
Yet the squeeze beam still must be physically generated, and this along with optical losses in the interferometer prove a much more significant challenge than theoretical constraints.

%Squeezed state made with
%optical parameter oscillator, 2nd harmonic generator
Squeezing can be physically generated through the use of an optical parametric oscillator (OPO).
Optical parameteric amplifiers, including an OPO, involve a nonlinear optical medium that is pumped with an electromagnetic wave at $\omega_p$.
An OPO~\cite{Caves1981} is an optical parametric amplifier for which the output `signal' (at $\omega_s$) and `idler' (at $\omega_i$) beams\footnote{The nomenclature is historical, sometimes distinguished by $\omega_s\geq\omega_i$. After alignment is complete, the output beams contain no power by design.} are degenerate (for any amplifier they satisfy $\omega_s + \omega_i$ = $\omega_p$, the input, pump frequency).
As Takahashi noted~\cite{Takahashi1965} (and others, see Wall for a review~\cite{Walls1983}), a degenerate amplifier will transform a coherent state into a state with unequal uncertainties in its two quadratures, to wit, phase and amplitude.

By placing a degenerate amplifier in cavity resonant at $\omega_s$, the amplifier becomes an optical parameter \textit{oscillator}, with high effective interaction length and thus squeeze factor.
Nonlinear media come in many varieties, but the material used in LIGO squeezing experiments (as in this chapter) has typically been PPKTP (periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate).
For an effective second-order nonlinear susceptability $d$, pump electric field amplitude $E_p$, effective interaction length $L$, and index of refraction at the signal frequency $n_s$, the amount of squeezing is~\cite{Caves1981},

\begin{equation}
r = \left(\frac{4\pi \omega_s L}{c n_s} \right) d |E_p|.
\label{how_much_squeezing}
\end{equation} 

\noindent One caveat: the pump must be phase matched to the main laser (at $\omega$) of the overall interferometer.
This is usually accomplished (as at the Hanford experiment) with a small beamsplitter siphoning a portion of the laser (then, at Hanford, through a polarization-preserving fiber) and directing it to a second harmonic generator (SHG), which yielded $\omega_p = 2\omega$.
SHGs themselves operate using non-linear crystals to frequency-double incident laser light.

A heuristic understanding\footnote{Popularized by Daniel Sigg.} of the OPO (when $\omega_p = 2\omega)$ is that a vacuum fluctuation $\epsilon$ at $A e^{i\omega_\epsilon t + \phi_\epsilon}$ couples to the pump and so induces a second beam at amplitude $A e^{i\left(2\omega - (\omega_\epsilon t + \phi_\epsilon)\right)}$.
The superposition of these two beams has amplitude $\approx 2 A$ but phase $\approx (\phi_\epsilon - \phi_\epsilon)$, \textit{i.e.}, the ampltitude fluctuations (radiation pressure) have increased but the phase fluctuations (shot noise) have been reduced.

Demonstrated first at GEO600~\cite{GEO600NatureSqueezing} then on H1 at the LIGO Hanford Observatory~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}, squeezing is now a proven technique.
At Hanford, the subject of this chapter, 2.15 dB of squeezing (28\%, equivalent to a 64\% increase in laser power~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}) was achieved with the combined efforts of Sheila Dwyer, Sheon Chua, Lisa Barsotti, Matt Evans, Keita Kawabe, Daniel Sigg, Conor Mow-Lowry, Alexander Khalaidovski, Maxim Factourovich, Nicol\'{a}s Smith-Lefebvre, Robert Schofield, Mike Landry, Cheryl Vorvick, and Richard Gustafson.
The squeezing experiment was well-received by the entire staff\footnote{Quite busy themselves with Advanced LIGO installation.} of Hanford Observatory, to whom the squeezers were grateful.
This success encourages development of a production-quality squeezed light source for a future upgrade to Advanced LIGO, along the lines of Section~\ref{third-gen_squeezing}.
Squeezed light should increase aLIGO's performance and could prove critical to its successors, especially should they operate at cryogenic temperatures.

        \label{third-gen_squeezing}

Equation~\ref{squeeze_operator_caves} includes an angle $\omega$. When $\zeta$ is positive, squeezing is generated and phase fluctuations diminish, as discussed above. The converse, $\zeta$ negative, yields anti-squeezing, where amplitude fluctuations are smaller. The benefits

                Range estimation after squeezing

		From the improved shot noise, we can see that squeezing at high frequencies bought enhanced LIGO a megaparsec of inspiral range. This number is impressive in several respects: our goal was to acheive a squeezing factor of perhaps as much as 3 dB, but to do it in the shot noise-limited region, at high frequencies, where the inspiral range equations (MATH: add the inspiral range equation if not already shown for feedforward!) count for much less. Morever, that range figure reflects the acheivement of squeezing down to 150 Hz, which is the lowest yet achieved for a gravitational wave interferometer, as can be seen in the Nature Photonics paper~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}


\section{Squeezing large interferometers}

        \subsection{Success and Advanced LIGO prospects}
        \label{squeezing_success}
            Results and hopes for aLIGO+ squeezing.

	    The squeezer group has a paper pending in review for Nature, written by Lisa Barsotti, in which we discuss our acheivement of perhaps 2 dB worth of squeezing (need to cite and check whether it is OK to use this number)~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}. It builds on the previous success of GEO600 in squeezing~\cite{GEO600NatureSqueezing}.

	    Discuss Sheila Dwyer's~\cite{DwyerPhaseNoise} and Sheon Chua's~\cite{ChuaBackscatteredLight} papers, since I am an author on both of them. We have a preliminary understanding now of at least two major problems: the quadrature phase noise fluctatuations and backscattered light. Backscattered light can be resolved in several ways. Phase noise must be progressively improved, as Sheila discusses, because we can hope to acheive the mature filter cavity design proposed below.

Discuss Lisa Barsotti's talk about the future prospect for LIGO using filter cavities, work that Tomoki Isogai is doing. With filter cavities, we can acheive frequency-dependent squeezing, having the best of both works by reducing quantum radiation pressure noise at low frequencies and shot noise at high, by using the filter cavity to produce a squeezed vacuum with a squeeze angle that varies as a function of frequency. Though as yet this filter cavity has yet to be constructed, it is in the works at MIT.
