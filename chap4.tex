Running TwoSpect as a directed search algorithm involves calculating
the $R$-detection statistic across the probable parameter space. 
A search is conducted with templates for each grid point in the Scorpius 
X-1 parameter space; period is known sufficient well to restrict the search
to the two dimensions of signal frequency and frequency modulation. The
grid spacing, inversely proportional to spectrum coherence time, was
chosen to allow a mismatch no more than $0.2$ in the detection statistic.
Due to known period and sky location, the incoherent harmonic sum stage
of TwoSpect, used for the all-sky search, was bypassed entirely. 

Each interferometer in the data challenge was analyzed individually for 
the detection statistic and corresponding single-template $p$-value. A set
of highest $p$-value outliers in 5 Hz bands were produced for each 
interferometer, subject to a $p$-value threshold inferred from Gaussian noise.
These sets were compared in pairwise coincidence (H1-L1, H1-V1, or L1-V1),
where coincidence required proximity within a few grid points in the 
parameter space. Any surviving outliers were classified as a detection. 

The highest $p$-value outlier in a single interferometer in that band 
yielded the estimated parameters. Uncertainties in these parameters were also
determined from unblinded injections, using method of moments for signal
frequency and modulation depth and confidence intervals for signal
amplitude. Upper limits were declared from the best estimate of the 95
percent confidence level of non-detected unblinded injected signals. The
largest uncertainty in upper limits and signal amplitude estimation derives
from the ambiguity in between true $h_0$ signal and $\cos \iota$ inclination.
This ambiguity cannot be resolved with the present algorithm and depends
partially on the assumed prior distribution of signal ampltitudes; the
uncertainty was estimated by simulation.  

TwoSpect claimed to detect 34 of 50 blinded signals and stated a flat
$4.23 \times 10^{-25}$ upper limit for the 16 non-detected signals. 


\textbf{MDC procedure}
\newline
\textit{Detection Claims}

After studying the Gaussian noise in the Scorpius X-1 MDC open data set, we were able to set thresholds for detection claims.

TwoSpect's R-statistic and p-value space on {frequency}x{modulation depth} showed significant structures, particular around loud injections, corresponding to the distribution of power into pixels by way of modulation depth, Earth's Doppler motion, and possibly spectral leakage. These regions of the open data set parameter space were excised before proceeding with the Gaussian noise study.

TwoSpect also found differences in the noise between the 360 s SFTs, used for pulsar bands above 360 Hz, and the 840 s SFTs, used for those bands below. The shorter SFTs were noisier.

After studying the effect of pairwise coincidence requirements on surviving Gaussian noise outliers, we were satisfied that we would achieve a false alarm rate of 0.01 or better by setting the following detection criteria. Note that the log10p values refer to single-template p-values, which are generally correlated with each other.

Detection criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item each candidate must survive at least one double-IFO coincidence test, involving a pairwise comparison of single-IFO candidates to see whether they are within 1/Tsft in both frequency (f) and modulation depth (df).
\item single-IFO candidates are the up-to-200 most extreme p-value outliers in a 5 Hz band that had a log10p $\leq$ threshold, where threshold = -7.75 if f $<$ 360.0 Hz (those that used 840 s SFTs) or -12.0 if f $\geq$ 360.0 Hz (those that used 360 s SFTs).
\end{itemize}

$\rightarrow$ if there is any candidate surviving these criteria in a 5 Hz band, we mark detected, else not detected

\textit{Parameter Estimation}

Open MDC data gave TwoSpect the the ability to check its parameter estimation on the 31 pulsars detected in the open data set.

Note that the h0 reported in this section had not yet been recalibrated for either the $\cos \iota$ ambiguity due to assumed circular polarization (see subsequent section, factor of 1.74) or a systematic rescaling endemic to TwoSpect (factor of 1.11). Instead, the first step was to rescale the known h0-injected from the MDC open data table into an h-effective. This h-effective equaled $\sqrt{ ((1+\cos^2 \iota) / 2)^2 + (\cos \iota)^2 }/\sqrt{2}$ * h0-injected, the rescaling necessary to convert the strain into effective units of circular polarization strain. Any pipeline that assumes circular polarization should require a similar procedure.

We plotted the error in the h0 reported by TwoSpect versus h0-effective for the 31 open pulsars detected.

FIGURE
detectedHerrVsHeffective.png

This same error was also plotted vs p-value and frequency. As will be seen on the plots for error in frequency and asini, high-frequency outliers were found in the open data set. These outliers could be categorized heuristically as having f $>$ 1050 Hz and abs(log10p) $<$ 300. These 4 outliers were assigned into the "loose" category, with a corresponding sigma. The remaining 27 were in the "tight" category, to which we could assign a more stringent sigma. These values are reported in the header of the graphs.

Blue lines indicate the less stringent uncertainty. Red lines (on plots vs p-value) indicate a least squares power law regression.

\textit{Upper Limits and Detection Efficiency}

Upper limits and detection efficiency were also calculated using data in the open pulsar set.

For detection efficiency, we calculated the h-effective for the 31 detected and 19 non-detected pulsars and found the average detection rate in bins according to h-effective. These bins were non-uniform in size due to the interest in finding the 95\% detection efficiency point despite the paucity of statistics (only 50 pulsars total). Binomial uncertainty was also calculated and subtracted, by bin. The 95\% level is very approximately about 3e-25 (again, without the corrective factors of 1.75 and 1.11) but is imprecise to judge using this method.

FIGURE
detectionVsHeffective.png

Consequently we plotted the distribution of recovered h0 versus injected h0-effective (the error of which is shown above, for detected pulsars). Color-coding red pulsars as non-detected, blue as single pairwise detection, and green as triple pairwise detection, we identified a shelf of non-detected pulsars that was 95\% contained by an upper limit about 2.19e-25. This number, when corrected, yielded the upper limit of 1.74*1.11*2.19e-25 = 4.23e-25 for TwoSpect.

FIGURE
HrecoveredVsHeffectiveFullUL.png

Further injection studies should show how this upper limit varies with frequency as injected h0, but at the time of the MDC, we did not feel confident in extrapolating this relationship.
\newline
\textit{$\cos \iota$ Ambiguity}

$\cos \iota$, the cosine of the inclination angle of the pulsar, casts an ambiguity over the determination of h0. For TwoSpect, which assumes circular polarization, the true value of h0 will indeed be as reported if cos iota = 1, but will be greater if cos iota is less (i.e., the gravitational wave is elliptically polarized). In the case of linear polarization, h0 will be $2^{3/2}$ times larger than reported.

While an analytical calculation of the expectation value of the correction factor is easy, it will not easily take into account the circular bias of detected signals. That is, a pipeline will tend to see a slightly greater proportion of signals that are more circularly polarized, because the effective h0 of those signals is greater. This "circularizes" the correction factor in a way dependent on the detection efficiency of the pipeline and the assumed prior distribution of pulsars. Although the effect is relatively minor, we decided to simulate it because the size of the effect was unknown at the time.

In this simulation, 2 million pulsars were generated with h0 between 3e-26 and 3-24 (a rough guess at the scope of the MDC) with a distribution of 1/h0.

We made a toy model of our detection efficiency, assuming no pulsars were detected below 1e-25 effective, all were above 3e-25, and the fraction detected was linear in h0 between those values.

FIGURE
PlotHeffDistH0DetectionEfficiency200breaks.png

Together with a uniform cos iota distribution on [-1, 1], this led to a trapezoidal distribution of recovered, detected h0 values with a curved lower (left) edge:

FIGURE
PlotHEffDistH0Detected.png

The upper end of the distribution (right side of the trapezoid) was excluded because we are trying to find the average bijective mapping (slope) f: (detected h0) $\rightarrow$ (true h0), and including detected h0 $>$ 1e-24 meant that we were failing to see the complete injected h0 space. There was f$^{-1}$: (true h0) $\rightarrow$ (detected h0), but not f. More plainly, suppose we looked at a detected h0 reported as 1.5e-24, and that our average corrected factor had been calculated to be 2.5 (it was not) -- this would imply that the true h0 was 3.75e-24 -- but this would be outside the domain of the simulation, so there would be no way to check it. The analogous problem should not happen at the lower end of the distribution (left side of the trapezoid).

In turn, we looked for the relationship between the recovered h0 of this "detected" distribution and the corresponding original, true h0. The slope would give us the conversion factor. The first attempt was to grid the {detected h0}x{true h0} space into 2D pixels. This was suggestive, and yielded the following regressed slope:

FIGURE
PlotHeffVsH0TrueRegressions.png

There is a systematic bias in the grid method, both by one pixel (hence why the mean was adjusted downward to 1.74) and in the associated uncertainties. Plotting these uncertainties on the distribution of {detected h0} vs {true h0} shows how wide those error bars are.

FIGURE
PlotHEffVsH0TrueWithLines.png

This bias is likely due to sampling: numerical fluctuations in the grid method made it unstable at the 2 million pulsar level, especially toward the high h0 end of the distribution. Instead, we manually adjusted a $\pm \sigma$ until the CDF encompassed the appropriate 68\% confidence interval, finding a sigma in the slope of 0.37 with a mean slope of 1.74. The reason for the aforementioned restriction of the plot to h-effective $<$ 1e-24 can be seen in the distortion at levels above that in the following plot:

FIGURE
PlotSigmaDiffVsH0Eff.png

The chosen $1.74 \pm 0.37 \sigma$, however, yielded the necessary correction factor.

Finally, we tested all of our calibration factors for h0 with the associated confidence intervals and found the fraction of open data estimated h0, f and asini within their 1 sigma error bars. The results were conservative:

h0: 0.7741935 (77.4\%)
f: 0.7419355 (74.2\%)
asini: 0.6774194 (67.7\%)
Period: 1.00 (100\%) [n.b., we only tested one period, 68023.8259 s]

These error bars were then used without modification for claiming uncertainties on the closed pulsars.
