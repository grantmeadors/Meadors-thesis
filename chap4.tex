Gravitational wave interferometry measures changes in light travel time far less than the light-crossing time of an atom, so the quantum nature of light has always influenced detector design.
Advanced LIGO aims to resolve most of noise sources described in Sections~\ref{methods} and~\ref{interferometer_theory}: even so, quantum shot and radiation pressure noise from light will remain.
Carlton Caves correctly derived the quantum behavior of interferometer shot and radiation pressure noise~\cite{Caves1980}.
Prior work had inferred the shot noise level from classical principles, accurately, but been ambiguous about radiation pressure.
With the quantum noise clarified, it was realized that this noise could be reduced through so-called squeezing of the vacuum state~\cite{Caves1981}.
This chapter describes part of how squeezing was successfully realized three decades later at the LIGO Hanford Observatory.
For additional details, consult Chua~\cite{ChuaThesis} and Dwyer~\cite{DwyerThesis}.

    \section{Squeezing theory}
    \label{squeezing_theory}

      %  Squeezing theory.
Quantum noise was initially treated as Poissonian photon counting (shot noise) and momentum coupling (radiation pressure), but it is better understood as the phase and amplitude uncertainty of the electromagnetic field at the interferometer output. 
Roughly speaking, phase uncertainty is equivalent to semi-classical shot noise and amplitude uncertainty to radiation pressure.
The standard quantum limit (SQL) on displacement sensitivity can be derived independently of either argument, as noted by Caves~\cite{Caves1981}:

\begin{equation}
(\Delta z)_{\textup{SQL}} = (2 \hbar \tau / m)^{1/2},
\label{sql_caves}
\end{equation}

\noindent where in Equation~\ref{sql_caves} $z$ is the mirror (test mass) displacement, $\tau$ is measurement duration, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $m$ is mirror mass.
When one tries to attain this standard quantum limit with an interferometer, then shot and radiation pressure are found to balance at a particular optimum input power $P_0$~\cite{Caves1981}:

\begin{equation}
P_0 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{mc^2}{\tau}\frac{1}{\omega \tau} \frac{1}{b^2},
\label{optimum_power_caves}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\omega$ the angular frequency of light and $b$ the number of bounces (assuming delay lines, whereas a Fabry-Perot is proportional to finesse) in Equation~\ref{optimum_power_caves}.
The latter equation shows that the optimal power rises as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, that is, as the squart root of the gravitational wave frequency.
Higher laser power improves high frequency sensitivity, high mirror mass improves low frequency performance.
Combined, these formulae imply that an interferometer should be built with the largest, most massive mirrors and most powerful lasers practicable.

LIGO and its allied interferometers do try to operate with massive optics and powerful lasers, but there are limits.
Vacuum enclosures place a constraint, only broken with significant expenditures, on the size of optical tables and mirror suspensions and therefore on mirror mass.
This indirectly limits laser power through the SQL.
Laser power, however, was not limited for this reason in initial and enhanced LIGO.
In practice, thermal distortion of the test masses was a worse problem~\cite{BallmerThesis}.
Absorption, both in the bulk of the fused silica substrate and in the HR coatings, of a few parts per million was sufficient to distort the radius of curvature of the Fabry-Perot cavities.
While managed with a $\textup{CO}_2$ laser-driven thermal compensation system (supplemented with ring heaters in aLIGO), this thermal distortion remains a serious concern.

Having an alternative to increased mirror size and laser power would grant flexibility.
Hence squeezing: the standard quantum limit can be achieved through another means.

This initial design for the table leg extensions on the squeezer table incorporated a flange, which was removed immediately prior to fabrication, replaced with a larger diameter flangeless tube with incorporated tap-holes. Flanges were thought necessary for a flexible alignment initially, they would be prohibitively expensive to machine, and welding would induce unacceptable distortions into the metal. Design in consultation with Daniel Sigg, Lisa Barsotti, Keita Kawabe, Gerardo Moreno, Richard Savage.

            \subsubsection{Figures of merit: inspiral range}
            \label{range_est}

                Range estimation after squeezing

		From the improved shot noise, we can see that squeezing at high frequencies bought enhanced LIGO a megaparsec of inspiral range. This number is impressive in several respects: our goal was to acheive a squeezing factor of perhaps as much as 3 dB, but to do it in the shot noise-limited region, at high frequencies, where the inspiral range equations (MATH: add the inspiral range equation if not already shown for feedforward!) count for much less. Morever, that range figure reflects the acheivement of squeezing down to 150 Hz, which is the lowest yet achieved for a gravitational wave interferometer, as can be seen in the Nature Photonics paper~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}


\section{Squeezing large interferometers}

        \subsection{Success and Advanced LIGO prospects}
        \label{squeezing_success}
            Results and hopes for aLIGO+ squeezing.

	    The squeezer group has a paper pending in review for Nature, written by Lisa Barsotti, in which we discuss our acheivement of perhaps 2 dB worth of squeezing (need to cite and check whether it is OK to use this number)~\cite{BarsottiNatureSqueezing}. It builds on the previous success of GEO600 in squeezing~\cite{GEO600NatureSqueezing}.

	    Discuss Sheila Dwyer's~\cite{DwyerPhaseNoise} and Sheon Chua's~\cite{ChuaBackscatteredLight} papers, since I am an author on both of them. We have a preliminary understanding now of at least two major problems: the quadrature phase noise fluctatuations and backscattered light. Backscattered light can be resolved in several ways. Phase noise must be progressively improved, as Sheila discusses, because we can hope to acheive the mature filter cavity design proposed below.

Discuss Lisa Barsotti's talk about the future prospect for LIGO using filter cavities, work that Tomoki Isogai is doing. With filter cavities, we can acheive frequency-dependent squeezing, having the best of both works by reducing quantum radiation pressure noise at low frequencies and shot noise at high, by using the filter cavity to produce a squeezed vacuum with a squeeze angle that varies as a function of frequency. Though as yet this filter cavity has yet to be constructed, it is in the works at MIT.
