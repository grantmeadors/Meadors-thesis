    \label{cycles}

        %How it all fits together.

Science connects us to the world. 
From \textit{scientia} to \textit{Wissenschaft}, science has ever connoted both sense and wisdom.
It is how humanity takes in from, and the arts are how humanity gives back to, nature.
Yet the neat duality of modern identity is no more mysterious than those in modern physics.
Experimental physics unites insight and craft: it makes tools of discovery.
As physicists, our aspiration to know the cosmos is realized if and only if that knowledge is both true and understood.

For the present, we do strive for gravitational wave astronomy to be understood, as Chapter~\ref{chap7}.
Above all, we must know whether it is true.
The author's projects detailed in Chapters~\ref{chap2} through~\ref{chap6} explain how we may yet learn what is.

        \subsection{Improvements to observatories}
        \label{observatories_better}

           % Enhancements like enhanced/advanced LIGO and squeezing.
Gravitational wave interferometry is a young science.
The astrophysical potential is even more nascent.
Chapter~\ref{chap2} details how the LIGO Scientific Collaboration is reaching out to our colleagues in the astronomical community to unite our view of the universe.
First, we must have a view. 
In that chapter, the author discusses contributions made to characterizing the LIGO Hanford Observatory, building a phase camera for use in future interferometers, and studying detector glitches.
Chapter~\ref{chap4} shows that more fundamental improvements are possible.
By way of quantum optical squeezing, the standard quantum limits of the electromagnetic field can be surpassed.
Using squeezing \textit{in lieu} of laser power, the observatory reached unprecedented sensitivity.

        \subsection{Understanding instruments, refining data}
        \label{instrumental_understanding_data_refinements}

            ....necessitate detector characterization, like scans and filters
            ....automated feedforward filters yield own enhancements

        %\subsection{Refining data}
        %\label{data_refinements}


        \subsection{Searching deep-space}
        \label{searching_space}

            ...TwoSpect and other searches benefit

        \subsection{Reaching out, looking up}
        \label{reaching_out}

            ...Outreach makes research accessible to public.

    \section{Scientific merit: filtering and analysis}
    \label{merit}

        Core projects.

        \subsection{Feedforward improvement to LIGO data}
        \label{feedforward_end}

            Evaluate success of feedforward.

        \subsection{TwoSpect directed search for neutron stars in binary systems}
        \label{TwoSpect_end}

            ...and TwoSpect-directed.

            One thought that might develop into something more fruitful is as follows.

            Someday deconvolve, maybe Bayesian, the skymaps and parameter space spread of TwoSpect with simulation to understand what we are really seeing. Cannot do all templates in paramter space, but only need a few to compare -- in a way, it already does.

    \section{Entering the advanced detector era}

        Advanced LIGO: how much better can we do?

        Why GW astronomy at all? What could be out there?

        Gravity is the universe. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Standard Model of physics, and quantum field theory in general, can be studied on curved spacetime, but the spacetime itself remains scarcely better understood than when Einstein first proposed it general relativity. 
After almost a century, the fabric of the universe is still unyielding of its secrets. 
Gravitational wave astronomy will be the first science to perceive that fabric directly. 

        In this thesis, we have made inroads to this new astronomy. Superficially seperate, the common thread is the pursuit of fundamental issues by skillful choice of perspective. 
With squeezing, the optical experimenter views a gravitational wave interferometer as a quantum system and sees how fluctuations in the vacuum, not just in the laser, create noise -- which can be cancelled with a beam of no-light.
With feedforward, the noise due to intrinsic couplings between the interferometer servos is found by coherence in the frequency domain -- and cancelled with subtraction that can take place either in real-time or long afterward.
With TwoSpect, signals buried beneath noise are uncovered by comparing multiple instruments -- cancelling noise, in effect, with the build-up of signal in other observatories.
Communicating these advances to a wider world is the final question of fundamental issues and choice of perspective.
Gravitational wave observations have not yet seen a signal, yet we find ways to make our research meaningful.

Until we can understand gravity, we will be ignorant to the range of forces present in the cosmos.
LIGO is a way to hear the echoes of gravitation.
For long-lasting signals, we can even `see' them, just as our ears can echolocate sounds.
 From the windswept, tumbleweed-coated plains of Hanford and the primordial swamps of Livingston may emerge our first visions of this thus-far dark sky. From it may come unexpected sources. Even if, though, we see only what we imagine will be seen, the insight into the hearts of neutron stars, the explosions of giant suns, the collisions of black holes, and the earliest, as-yet opaque instants of the universe will be wonder enough. The author can only hope to have contributed in some small way to this project.
