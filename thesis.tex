%This author should give thanks far beyond a simple page. It is too soon to write something so important.

Thanks should go beyond a simple page. 
Lest I forget, let me reflect on all the people without whom I would not have made it here. 
To my parents, Erin Ann Bridget O'Rourke-Meadors and Gregory David Meadors, and my brother, Patrick Thomas Meadors. 
My grandmother, Florenceann O'Rourke (n\'{e}e Williams), made my undergraduate studies at Reed College possible.
Hanford gave much-needed time to learn my family's stories.
How wonderful it would be if my paternal grandparents, Shuler and Jeanne (Brown) Meadors, could be here too.
Ethan Obie Romero-Severson is ever a devoted friend and colleague in mathematics and adventures: Team Science for four years and counting!

Keith Riles has been a dedicated and conscientious adviser: steady progress is how new science is born -- detecting gravitational waves is a tricky task, and his thoughtful attention to details will be part of what makes it possible.
Dick Gustafson introduced me to the field in 2005 and has helped ever since; my only regret working with him is that we never flew the glider, although we nearly won a sailboat regatta.

Evan Goetz pioneered this kind of search, paving the way: Oregon makes good scientists.
Best to my office-mates, Jax Sanders \& Santiago Caride, on their way soon!
Keita Kawabe is a concerted collaborator and experimenter, attentive and dilligent.
Chris Messenger ever-patiently organized the data challenge and has a keen eye for the future.
Marco Cavaglia orchestrated the World Science Festival exhibition, with all its fun.

Mike Landry encouraged me to come for my sojourn at Hanford and made it a welcoming place.
Sheila Dwyer and Sheon Chua, helped me see the squeezed light at the end of the beam tube.
Conor Mow-Lowry and Alexander Khalaidovski, were likewise great squeezer friends. 
Nicol\'{a}s Smith-Lefebvre has been there in LIGO since I started.
Lisa Barsotti \& Matt Evans and Daniel Sigg made our whole quantum optics experiment possible.

Dale Ingram helped me lead my first public LIGO tours.

To my physics friends at Michigan, one of the most tight-knit cohorts, thank you too.
My gratitude especially to Michelle Adan, Matt Bales \& Amanda Boomer, Kevin Bergemann, Alex Burgers and Bo Zhang, for all having organized our Get-a-Job meetings to get over the final hurdles.
Melinda Morang helped me find little brown birds -- and my friend Beverly Lau from Reed helped me appreciate all the other animals.

Reed's professors helped launch me to Michigan.
Robert Reynolds advised my undergraduate thesis and showed how really to use a telescope.
David Griffiths filled me with enthusiasm for physics that last to this day.
Johnny Powell always had sound advice.
Joel Franklin helped me appreciate what gravitational waves meant.
Tom Wieting almost converted me to mathematics with his inimitable style of geometry.
Ginny Hancock has a sound ear for music and life's many challenges.
Directing the Reactor, Stephen Frantz and Rachel Barnett created the critical conditions for practicing science and meeting dear friends: our elements are fissioned now, but that core made us into new isotopes.
Without their hard work in Portland, I might not be here in Ann Arbor.

Epidemiology compatriots have made Ann Arbor my home: thanks to Meghan Milbrath (follow the bees), Ian Spicknall (thanks for the coffee), Erin Shellman and Bryan Mayer (who read my whole thesis) -- everyone in Edit Club is a Doctor now!

Psychology teammates, Emily Bonem, Ali Earl, and Stephanie Carpenter, brought me through a long winter: good luck, loose seals.
Even the sky is not the limit for my Michigan Flyers instructors, Anthony Sumner and especially (Amelia C.) Jayne.
And to my dear friends Aric Knuth of English and James Leija of the University Musical Society, who revitalized a love of literature and art, and who brought me in one Thanksgiving.
Thanks I give now again.

May my coming endeavor at the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover help us travel through, and shrink, space and time, just like a gravitational wave.
Read on -- for more still, named within, made this work a reality.

{Directed searches for continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars in binary systems } {Grant David Meadors} {Chair: John Keith Riles}

Gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) seek to observe ripples in space predicted by General Relativity. 
Black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, the Big Bang and other sources should radiate GWs.
Original contributions to LIGO are presented in this thesis: feedforward filtering, directed binary neutron star searches for continuous waves, and scientific outreach and education, as well as advances in quantum optical squeezing.

Feedforward filtering can remove extraneous noise from servo-controlled instruments.
Filtering of the last science run, S6, improves LIGO's astrophysical range (+4.14\% H1, +3.60\% L1: +12\% volume) after subtracting noise from auxiliary length control channels.
This thesis shows how filtering enhances the scientific sensitivity of LIGO's data set during and after S6, and the approaches to non-stationarity and to verifying calibration and integrity may apply to comparable methods of interest for Advanced LIGO.

Squeezing is planned for future interferometers to exceed the standard quantum limit on noise from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations; this thesis discusses the integration of a prototype squeezer at LIGO Hanford Observatory and ensuing astrophysical potential.  

Continuous waves (CW) from neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems such as Scorpius X-1 are a promising source of GWs.
The directed binary search, called TwoSpect, was the most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data presented in this thesis, projecting an upper limit of $4.23\times 10^{-25}$ in strain, given a year-long data set at an Advanced LIGO design sensitivity of $4\times 10^{-24}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$.
TwoSpect is also used on real S6 data to set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain from Scorpius X-1; millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305 is similarly considered.
Search enhancements for Advanced LIGO are proposed.

Advanced LIGO and fellow interferometers should detect GWs in the coming decade.
Methods in these thesis will benefit both the instrumental and analytical sides of observation.

%Gravitational wave (GW) detectors should soon reveal the universe in a way unlike any existing kind of telescope. 
%These waves, predicted by General Relativity, radiate from accelerating gravitational quadrupoles, such as black holes, neutron stars and the Big Bang. 
%Indirect evidence for GW comes from the work of Hulse and Taylor; the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and allies seek to observe GWs directly. 
%In this thesis, I discuss the goals and history of the LIGO project and the theory and practice of its operation, including my contributions to the scientific collaboration in feedforward signal filtering, directed binary pulsar star searches, and scientific outreach and education to the next generation of young scientists. 
%Filtering improves LIGO range in the last science run, S6, by 4.14\% (H1) and 3.60\% (L1). 
%The directed binary search, most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data, has set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain in S6.
