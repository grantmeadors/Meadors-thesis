{Directed searches for continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars in binary systems } {Grant David Meadors} {Chair: John Keith Riles}

Gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) seek to observe ripples in space predicted by General Relativity. 
Black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, the Big Bang and other sources should radiate GWs.
Original contributions to LIGO are presented in this thesis: feedforward filtering, directed binary neutron star searches for continuous waves, and scientific outreach and education, as well as advances in quantum optical squeezing.
Filtering of the last science run, S6, improves LIGO's astrophysical range (+4.14\% H1, +3.60\% L1: +12\% volume) after subtracting noise from auxiliary length control channels, of interest for Advanced LIGO.
The directed binary search, most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data, has set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain in S6 from Scorpius X-1; the millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305 is also considered.
This search method will be used for Advanced LIGO analysis.

%Gravitational wave (GW) detectors should soon reveal the universe in a way unlike any existing kind of telescope. 
%These waves, predicted by General Relativity, radiate from accelerating gravitational quadrupoles, such as black holes, neutron stars and the Big Bang. 
%Indirect evidence for GW comes from the work of Hulse and Taylor; the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and allies seek to observe GWs directly. 
%In this thesis, I discuss the goals and history of the LIGO project and the theory and practice of its operation, including my contributions to the scientific collaboration in feedforward signal filtering, directed binary pulsar star searches, and scientific outreach and education to the next generation of young scientists. 
%Filtering improves LIGO range in the last science run, S6, by 4.14\% (H1) and 3.60\% (L1). 
%The directed binary search, most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data, has set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain in S6.
