{Directed searches for continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars in binary systems } {Grant David Meadors} {Chair: John Keith Riles}

Gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) seek to observe ripples in space predicted by General Relativity. 
Black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, the Big Bang and other sources should radiate GWs.
Original contributions to LIGO are presented in this thesis: feedforward filtering, directed binary neutron star searches for continuous waves, and scientific outreach and education, as well as advances in quantum optical squeezing.

Feedforward filtering can remove extraneous noise from servo-controlled instruments.
Filtering of the last science run, S6, improves LIGO's astrophysical range (+4.14\% H1, +3.60\% L1: +12\% volume) after subtracting noise from auxiliary length control channels.
This thesis shows how filtering enhances the scientific sensitivity of LIGO's data set during and after S6, and the approaches to non-stationarity and to verifying calibration and integrity may apply to comparable methods of interest for Advanced LIGO.

Squeezing is planned for future interferometers to exceed the standard quantum limit on noise from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations; this thesis discusses the integration of a prototype squeezer at LIGO Hanford Observatory and ensuing astrophysical potential.  

Continuous waves (CW) from neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems such as Scorpius X-1 are a promising source of GWs.
The directed binary search, called TwoSpect, was the most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data presented in this thesis, projecting an upper limit of $4.23\times 10^{-25}$ in strain, given a year-long data set at an Advanced LIGO design sensitivity of $4\times 10^{-24}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$.
TwoSpect is also used on real S6 data to set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain from Scorpius X-1; millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305 is similarly considered.
Search enhancements for Advanced LIGO are proposed.

Advanced LIGO and fellow interferometers should detect GWs in the coming decade.
Methods in these thesis will benefit both the instrumental and analytical sides of observation.

%Gravitational wave (GW) detectors should soon reveal the universe in a way unlike any existing kind of telescope. 
%These waves, predicted by General Relativity, radiate from accelerating gravitational quadrupoles, such as black holes, neutron stars and the Big Bang. 
%Indirect evidence for GW comes from the work of Hulse and Taylor; the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and allies seek to observe GWs directly. 
%In this thesis, I discuss the goals and history of the LIGO project and the theory and practice of its operation, including my contributions to the scientific collaboration in feedforward signal filtering, directed binary pulsar star searches, and scientific outreach and education to the next generation of young scientists. 
%Filtering improves LIGO range in the last science run, S6, by 4.14\% (H1) and 3.60\% (L1). 
%The directed binary search, most sensitive of 4 methods in simulated data, has set 95\% confidence upper limits (40 Hz to 2040 Hz) on GW strain in S6.
