{Directed searches for continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars in binary systems } {Grant David Meadors} {Chair: John Keith Riles}

Gravitational wave (GW) detectors would reveal the universe in a way unlike any existing kind of telescope. These waves, predicted by general relativity, radiate from accelerating gravitational quadrupoles, such as black holes, neutron stars and the Big Bang. Indirect evidence for GW comes from the work of Hulse and Taylor; the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and allies seek to observe gravitational waves directly. In this thesis, I discuss the goals and history of the LIGO project and the theory and practice of its operation, including my contributions to the scientific collaboration in feedforward signal filtering, directed binary pulsar star searches, and scientific outreach and education to the next generation of young scientists. (Probably conclude with a sentence describing numerical results of my projects, when known.)
