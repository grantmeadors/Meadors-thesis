An internal reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an input test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in differential arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel. To a lesser extent, changes in the length of PRC, which is defined as $\delta (l_+) \equiv \delta (l_y + l_x)/2$ and is measured in quadrature demodulation with respect to the MICH pick-off, also add noise to DARM}{figure.2.1}{}}
