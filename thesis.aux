\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ is derived from differential arm motion (DARM), read-out from a photodiode downstream of the antisymmetric port. An internal reflection off an anti-reflective coating, on either the beam-splitter (BS) or an input test mass (ITM), provides the Michelson (MICH) channel. The DARM readout channel predominantly measures the small change in differential arm length, $\delta (L_-) \equiv \delta (L_y - L_x)$, while MICH measures that in the Michelson length $\delta (l_-) \equiv \delta (l_y - l_x)$. There is also a small coupling from $\delta (l_-)$ to the DARM channel.
